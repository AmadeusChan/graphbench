GraphBench
==========

The goal of GraphBench is to aggregate application kernels, reference implementations, data-sets, data-set generators, documentation, specifications for generating standardized performance results, and a hosting service (http://graphbench.org) to provide public access to the benchmark and datasets.

This repository contains reference implementations that we couldn't find in existing framework distributions.

This is work in progress. Please [add to our wiki](https://github.com/uwsampa/graphbench/wiki) and link to your implementations and datasets!
