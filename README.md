graphbench
==========

A graph application benchmark suite

After running 'make', run 'gb' to run the banchmark.
Currently the program runs a bfs on a programmatically defined graph,
printing the base graph, the run time of the bfs (in ns), and the resulting
tree of shortest paths from the specified node.
