This directory contains a simple verify program called verify.py, using matplotlib, in order to verify if a dataset is social network.

It also contains the graphs produced by this program on the datasets we are interested in (not including the 2^25 twitter and 2^26 friendster dataset). 

Those datasets can be downloaded through the download.sh in the parent directory.
