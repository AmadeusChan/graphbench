download and install the pgx following the tutorial from Oracle:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/index.html

### Notice
Keep all the .java and .sh file in the same directory. 

Run the .sh file, pass in the correct parameters and the output will measure the processing time for the particular algorithm.   

For now, only the pgx-oracle framework is included. We will update when other frameworks are available.
