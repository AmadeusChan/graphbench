Contributing to GraphBench
==========================

Our philosophy in GraphBench is to prefer links to external resources that are maintained, rather than code/data in the GraphBench repo, in order to reduce maintenance overhead. When a contributor wants to commit code to the GraphBench repo, he or she must take responsibility for keeping that code/data up to date.

What to contribute
------------------

TBD


Dealing with large files
------------------------

Some datasets are prohibitively large. We suggest these are hosted on Amazon S3, under a user-pays model. More info will be provided here in the future.
